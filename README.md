## 🐍 For the Full Experience (with Python) 🐍
If you're a python developer, you may be aware that python doesn't get much love from VS Code when it comes to syntax highlighting.
To get the best syntax highlighting experience with `.py` files, follow these steps:

1. Install [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance)
2. Put the following in your `settings.json`
```js
"editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations": {
    "enabled": true,
},
```
